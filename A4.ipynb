    "## **Overview and Research Questions** ##\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 has impacted the lives of many and has been ever-present in society since late 2019. Since it became a pandemic there have been several organizations collecting data regarding many different variables connected to the virus and its spread. Because of this, there is a lot of data available that allows for different research questions to be asked and questioned. In this research exploration of the data will be done to answer some questions which are written below. \n",
    "\n",
    "It connects well to a human-centered perspective because as mentioned before it has impacted many people across the world. All people can make a connection to the virus and recall a time they, a relative, or a friend had tested positive for it. Making it beneficial to research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do the regulations and quarantining styles of different areas (cities, states, countries) at the beginning of COVID-19 show in the data?\n",
    "- Which areas had the best initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n",
    "- What patterns can be seen with the data over the years and change of regulations?\n",
    "- Are there changes with the variants of the COVID-19?\n",
    "- How do personal accounts differ from state to state, country to country?\n",
    "\n",
    "From these questions I would like to focus on the first, which relates to the regulations and quarantining styles of different areas at the beginning of COVID-19 and how it's shown in collected data. From this research I hope to find  patterns within the data and be able to connect it to the events that happened and how they impacted the total cases, vaccinations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**\n",
    "I believe that areas with stricter regulations had better responses to COVID-19, but there are certain locations where this backfired resulting in worse results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Motivation** ##\n",
    "I am planning to do this analysis because I recently had Covid and when thinking back\n",
    "I realized there is probably a lot of data that can be analyzed and trends can be found.\n",
    "It's beneficial and interesting because Covid has been such a big part of everyone's lives\n",
    "for the past few years. Making it a good topic to research because everyone has a connection\n",
    "to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this research I hope to find some patterns within the data and be able to connect it \n",
    "to events that happened and how they impacted the total cases, vaccinations, etc. I also wonder \n",
    "how it varied from state to state, country to country?\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Selected** ##\n",
    "I have found several datasets that vary. Many of them are graphs of the change in data. \n",
    "They have data from various areas which will help me with some questions I have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Links**\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus\n",
    "- https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/cases\n",
    "- **https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home**\n",
    "\n",
    "These all will be beneficial because they give both local and global data. They also provide\n",
    "demographics and trends during the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical concerns for me could be misinterpreting data and spreading misinformation.\n",
    "Also if there is any personal data, to respect it by not disclosing any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology** ##\n",
    "My process of analyzing the data may change over time due to complications, but for now my plan is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather the data from the three data sets and pick locations and dates I would like to look further into\n",
    "- Compare the data gathered through data visualization methods (bar charts). Much of the data is already put into easy to manage charts\n",
    "- If possible, gather qualitative data related to the location and time of the data\n",
    "- Look for  events and legislation that may be connected to the data\n",
    "- Based on the data and events theorize potential trends that are connected to research question\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for my data to be analyzed this way is because it is displayed in numbers but also in charts as well. Analyzing data visualizations will be important for this research. It will also be important to analyze the qualitative data well. This is because much of the theorizing will be done as the research is done.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## **Background and/or Related Work** ##\n",
    "There is a lot of available data related to COVID-19, specifically on the numbers for cases and deaths. There are also some studies that have been done previously that relate to how different areas responded to COVID-19. The two that stuck out to me were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/how-does-us-response-covid-19-compare-rest-world-\n",
    "- https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/08/11/partisanship-colors-views-of-covid-19-handling-across-advanced-economies/\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the different studies, I chose to continue with my study. The reason for this is because both of these studies were done in 2022, and it is now almost 2025 so the data may look a little different now. Also, a lot of the data they used to back up their claims are taken from their own gathering of data and not the official data sites that I will be gathering my data from. My approach will be different as I will be analyzing the data from datasets and comparing them area to area, which is similar, but different in the data being used. Also, I will incorporate past events and legislation to the reason behind the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Unknowns & Dependencies** ##\n",
    "Data could be incomplete in some areas as Covid is still ongoing and there could be times or areas\n",
    "where data couldn't be collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will also be difficult to determine which would be the best way to analyze data because there is a lot to unpack. Also deciding which site I would like to take data from. This could cause issues in the future.\n"
